![WP Pay Portal For Stripe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stimulussoft/wppayportal/master/img/logo.png)

_WP Pay Portal_ offers website designers the possibility to add Stripe subscription services to their Wordpress site. Using the portal, end-users can perform various management functions such as pay and download invoices and manage their Stripe subscriptions. 

The _Wordpress_ plugin is aimed at the end-users of a website, and not Administrators. Administrators are still expected to use the _Stripe_ website to perform advanced management functions.

# Compatibility

_WP Pay Portal_ is a plugin to ![Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.org) and integrates with ![Stripe](https://www.stripe.com). The plugin has been tested with _Wordpress V4.8.10_, and may work with other versions.

# Scope

Presently, the _WP Pay Portal_ plugin does not include mechanisms to control access to digital resources or services based on the status of a subscription within _Stripe_. This aspect is deemed outside the scope of _Wp Pay Portal_ and expected to be handled independently. In other words, another component in your solution ought to enforce the conditions of the subscription via separate connection to the _Stripe API_ or using another third-party solution in accordance with your needs.

Currently, _WP Pay Portal For Stripe_ deals with _Stripe_ subscriptions only, and does not offer a shopping cart or the ability to pay for non subscription related products and services.
